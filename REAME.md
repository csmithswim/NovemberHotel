1. Object oriented programming is a type of programming principle and paradigm that relies on four principles:
abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. 

2. OOP is very beneficial due to its four principles. These four principles, when implemented correctly, can make developing
programs a lot more straightforward and helps minimize rewriting redundant code. Abstraction makes OOP code a lot cleaner 
and succinct by organizing fields and methods in specific classes. Encapsulation also organizes anything relevant for a
particular class to be stored just in that class. Poly-morphism allows for methods to be overloaded and 
overrode and take multiple different types of data types. Inheritance allows classes to inheritance any methods and 
constructors from their parent classes.
